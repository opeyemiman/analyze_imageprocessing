# 🌱 functionland Script

*Functionland Script contains special functions called by main Scripts for performing further multispectral image processing, vegetation & sediment index computation, and pixel-level ML analysis.*

---

## 📖 Overview

FunctionLand is a collection of utilities for handling multispectral image data, extracting pixel samples, computing vegetation indices, performing rule-based/machine-learning masking, and analyzing canopy or vegetation structure.

This toolkit is designed for researchers, geologists, and civil engineers working with RGB + NIR imagery and ML-driven canopy mapping.

##  Installation

Clone the repo:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/opeyemiman/imageprocessing_plus.git
cd CEE_FunctionLand
```

Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

##  Quick Start

### **Load and reduce multispectral bands**

```python
from functions import acquire_bands, im_reduction3d

bands = acquire_bands("path/to/image_folder")
reduced = im_reduction3d(bands, block=4)
```

### **Compute NDVI**

```python
from functions import NDVI_calculator

ndvi = NDVI_calculator(bands)
```

### **Generate an ML mask**

```python
from functions import dnnmasker

mask = dnnmasker(bands, model="models/dnn_model.h5")
```

# 📘 Function Guide

Below is a friendly overview of the functions included in this repository.
Use it as a quick reference for what each function does and how it fits into your workflow.

---

## 🖼️ Image + Pixel Handling

### **`write_labeled_pixels()`**

Combines extract_pixels_by_polygon_with_deresolution() with capturepixellister() by writing labeled pixel samples to a CSV file to generate a training set from labelling COCO-JSON.

### **`extract_pixels_by_polygon_with_deresolution()`**

Extracts pixel values within polygon-shaped regions and optionally reduces resolution before writing to CSV.

### **`im_reduction3d()`**

Downscales a 3-band (RGB/NIR/etc.) image using block-compression.

### **`im_reduction2d()`**

Downscales 2D grayscale or single-band images.

### **`acquire_bands()`**

Loads aligned multispectral images and returns band arrays (blue, green, red, red-edge, NIR).


### **`greyscale_acquire()`**

Creates a greyscale visualization of aligned band stacks.

---

## 🌱 Vegetation & Sediment Index Calculations

### **`NDVI_calculator()`**

Calculates **NDVI** (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index).

### **`NDSSI_calculator()`**

Computes **NDSSI** (Normalized Difference Suspended Sediment Index)

### **`wen_algo()`**

Implements the Wen algorithm.

### **`NDRE_calculator()`**

Computes **NDRE** (Normalized Difference Red-Edge Index).

### **`NDWI_calculator()`**

Calculates **NDWI** (Normalized Difference Water Index) to evaluate moisture content.

---

## 📊 Analysis Tools

### **`capturepixellister()`**

Creates a combined pixel dataset of multiple indices and raw bands — ideal for ML workflows.

### **`analyze_pixel_data_from_csv()`**

Analyzes a CSV of pixel values and computes statistics across vertical canopy segments.

### **`masker()`**

Applies rule-based threshold masks on band or index values, with optional overlays.

---

## 🤖 Machine Learning Maskers

### **`dnnmasker()`**

Generates binary masks using a trained deep neural network.

### **`probdnnmasker()`**

Outputs **probability maps** from a DNN.

### **`rfmasker()`**

Predicts per-pixel masks using a Random Forest classifier.

### **`probrfmasker()`**

Outputs pixel-level **Random Forest probabilities**.

---

## 🗺️ Utility & Visualization

### **`plot_metadata_csv()`**

Creates plots/maps from metadata CSV files for visualization and analysis.
